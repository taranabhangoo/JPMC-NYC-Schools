# JPMC-NYC-Schools
REQUIREMENTS:

The app requirements are rather high-level and vague. If details are omitted, it is because we will be happy with any of a wide variety of functional solutions. Feel free to be creative and impress with code and UX (see more details down). You are allowed to use all the online resources you can find and use any 3rd party library if desired. Remember to make it useful for an actual user/student.

Create a native app (no react-native and no flutter) to provide information on NYC High schools.

Display a list of NYC High Schools.

Selecting a school should show additional information about the school
Display all the SAT scores - include Math, Reading and Writing.

It is up to you to decide what additional information to display.
In order to prevent you from running down rabbit holes that are less important to us, try to prioritize the following:

What is Important

Meet the basic App requirements.
The App should work like it would do in production â€“ error handling, edge conditions, stability and speed is important.
Well-constructed, easy-to-follow, commented code (especially comment hacks or workarounds made in the interest of expediency (i.e. // given more time I would prefer to wrap this in a blah blah blah pattern blah blah )).
Proper architecture with of separation of concerns and best-practice coding patterns.
Modern asynchronous programming techniques.
 

What is Less Important

Demonstrating technologies or techniques you are not already familiar with.
Only add code which you want us to read and judge you.
 

Bonus Points!

Good UX and UI
Use of MVVM Architecture
Samples of Unit testing. One of each kind rather than 100% code coverage.
Kotlin and related tools are preferred but not mandatory.
Use of Dependency injection.
